# Intro-to-Computer-Science-Programs-cpp-
These are the programs I wrote in my freshman year of high school. They were really simple C++ programs that my teacher assigned to us. I was more used to Java around this time and hadn't really touched C++ in a long time, so this code isn't written the best, but hopefully it will help someone.
